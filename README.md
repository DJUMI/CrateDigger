# Crate Digger

A smartphone app that recreates the record store experience that lets you dig through crates of music and buy records. Written entirely in JavaScript using the React Native framework and MongoDB databases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/). Install by running the command `npm install -g expo-cli`
* Expo app for Android or iOS.

### Installing and Running

Once Node.js and Expo CLI are downloaded and installed, `cd` into the Crate Digger directory and run the command `npm install` to download all dependencies.

Then, run `npm start` or `expo start` to start the app.

Once it has built, you can scan the QR code on the Expo app on your phone to open up the app (default is in development mode, but recommend switching to production mode).
